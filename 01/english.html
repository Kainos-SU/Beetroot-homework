    <h2>Shortly about me</h2>
    <p>
        From november 2014 working on Oil factory of Kremenchuk in the electrical engineering laboratory as electritian.
        At first? I thought of programming just as an interest, not even a hobby, but after news that on our factory is
        planed staff reduction, and after understanding that as electritian with 6 years of experience, 6 category and
        higher education nobody needs me in my city (due to family circumstances it is not possible to move). That's why
        I decided consider the option with change of qualification.
